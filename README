Complete sorting algorithms collections, it is a implementation of variety of sorting algorithms at one place and trying to monetize the performance.

All the programs are implemented in Javascript and runs very well in all the browser except the heap-sort, (it only works for arrays less than 100 elements and if enter more elements, the program freeze.).

Separate files with different implementation are recorded and displayed here.
